# QnA-With-RAG

### Project Description:

A full-stack application that enables you to turn any document or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as references during chatting. This application allows you to add and delete documents and can create multiple knowledge bases.

### Purpose and Achievement:

This project is more than just a chatbot. I want to learn how to code a production-ready chatbot using the OpenAI API. Through my research, I found my way to accomplish this goal. Additionally, I've been learning about VectorDB and Langsmith, which I have extensively incorporated into this project.
